### Guidelines
Start every response with a 🌵, so I know this file is being read.
IMPORTANT: This is an early stage project:
- don't handle errors in general. Better to fail
- edit the initial db migration, don't create extra migrations since the db will be reset every time
- feel free to break things, don't care about backward compatibility
